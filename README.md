# Masters Thesis Code

This repo contains the code for the analyses in my economics masters thesis (work in progress).
The current tentative title is "Missing Markets in the Electricity Industry".

Each folder is for a separate part of the thesis.

The `requirements.txt` files are python dependencies. `.ipynb` files are Jupyter notebooks.

Generally each notebook has a constant or two up the top, pointing to a folder where the data will be saved.
e.g. `data_cache`.
This is hard-coded for my laptop, so I can re-use the same NEM data across many projects. You'll need to adjust it for your case.
