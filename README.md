# Masters Thesis Code

This repo contains the code for the analyses in my economics masters thesis (work in progress).
The current tentative title is "Missing Markets in the Electricity Industry".

Each folder is for a separate part of the thesis.

The `requirements.txt` files are python dependencies. `.ipynb` files are Jupyter notebooks.
